Fragment of a mosaic depicting a horse wearing a saddle, facing right, on a white background. The horse is rendered with a thick outline of darker tesserae, its body is white. The saddle is decorated with a geometric pattern of triangles. Some landscape features are indicated (ivy branches, bushes, or small trees) below and in front of the horse. The mosaic is faint, yet the details are still visible and fairly well-preserved.
